# OLAP Operations on Global Superstore Dataset using Power BI

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** operations such as **Slicing, Dicing, Drill-Down, Drill-Up, and Roll-Up** using the `Global_Superstore2.csv` dataset in **Power BI Desktop**. It includes interactive dashboards for analyzing sales performance across different regions, categories, and time periods.

---

## üìÅ Dataset Used

- **Name:** Global_Superstore2.csv
- **Source:** Sample Superstore dataset (standard business dataset)
- **Attributes:**
  - Date fields: `Order Date`, `Ship Date`
  - Dimensions: `Region`, `Country`, `City`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Segment`
  - Measures: `Sales`, `Profit`, `Quantity`, `Discount`

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Visualize business metrics like Sales and Profit across different dimensions.
- Apply OLAP techniques for deeper data analysis:
  - **Slicing**: Filter data by Region, Category, etc.
  - **Drill-Down/Up**: Analyze data from Category ‚Üí Sub-Category.
  - **Roll-Up**: Aggregate data at Region or State level.
  - **Time Series Analysis**: Observe trends across months and years.

## ‚öôÔ∏è OLAP Operations Implemented

| OLAP Operation | Implementation Details |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Slicing**    | Slicers created for `Region`, `Category`, and `Order Date` |
| **Drill-Down** | Bar chart with hierarchy from `Category` ‚Üí `Sub-Category` |
| **Roll-Up**    | Matrix showing `Sales` and `Profit` by `Region` and `State` |
| **Time Drill** | Line chart showing `Profit` over time with Year/Month drill options |
